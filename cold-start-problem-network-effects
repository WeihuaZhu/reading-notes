# Reading Notes/Key takeaways

## Part 1 Network effects

Network effect: products get more valuable as more people use them.

- Uber: more users, more likely for riders to quickly find driver to get from A to B
- telephone: value depends on the connection with the other telephone and increases with the number of connections
- Instagram, reddit, tiktok, youtube, twitter: network of content creators, consumer and advertisers
- Airbnb: the network don’t own their underlying resources, it’s the connection that brings value.

The entire ecosystem stays on because the value is in brining everyone together.

Questions to ask to tell if a product has a network effect, and how strong it is:

- Does it have a network?
- Does it connect people with each other?
- Does attracting new users/stickier/monetize become stronger as its network grows larger?
- Does the user face a Cold Start problem?

launching new tech products today is extremely difficult

- Low defensibility: when sth works, others can follow and fast
- software has been easier to build but growing products has not
- constrained attention from users
- intense competition
- limited marketing channels to access new users
- network-based competitors
- uncler future app platforms

anti-network effect

Metcalfe’s Law: network value $\propto N^2$

flaw: didn’t consider

- the quality of user engagement
- multi-sideness of many networks, the hard side
- active users vs people who just signed up
- degraded experience as too many users start to overcrowd a network

Meerkat’s Law
